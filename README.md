# Skill Swap Platform 🤝

## 🎨 AI Instructions for Beautiful & Responsive Design

### Design Philosophy
Create a modern, clean, and intuitive interface that encourages skill sharing and community building.

### Visual Design Guidelines

#### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: Use warm, inviting colors (blues, greens) to build trust
- **Secondary**: Complementary accent colors for CTAs and highlights
- **Neutral**: Clean whites and light grays for backgrounds
- **Success**: Green tones for successful matches and completed exchanges

#### Typography
- **Headers**: Modern, bold sans-serif fonts (Inter, Poppins, or Roboto)
- **Body**: Readable, clean fonts with good contrast
- **Size Scale**: Responsive typography (clamp() for fluid scaling)

#### Layout & Spacing
- **Grid System**: CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive layouts
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing scale (8px base unit)
- **Containers**: Max-width containers with proper padding
- **Whitespace**: Generous use of whitespace for clarity

### Component Design Instructions
